# Tagram: Tag, Annotate, and Model User Stories

Tagram is a web platform designed to support the processing, tagging, and modeling of user stories. It facilitates the management of labeling projects, enabling efficient data handling for training machine learning models. Developed for the research of Mr. Maxim Bargilovsky and Prof. Arnon Sturm, Tagram aims to streamline the process of extracting meaningful insights from user stories.

## Features at a Glance

- **User Management:** Secure sign-up and login to manage individual accounts and track actions.
- **Annotation Project Creation:** Project managers can easily initiate new projects, upload data, and customize project settings.
- **Meta-Tagging:** Define and manage meta-tags with customizable names, colors, and types.
- **Tagging Process:** Comprehensive tagging capabilities with data export options.
- **Statistics Monitoring:** Detailed statistics for comparing tagging performance.
- **User-Stories Correction:** Tools for error correction and template validation.
- **Automatic Annotation:** Project managers can apply automatic annotations using machine learning models. They can upload a model, set a confidence threshold for accuracy, and compare the automatic annotations with those made by manual users.
