## What is Tagram?

##### A WEB platform that is an infrastructure for processing, tagging and modeling a set of user stories.
##### The system was built in order to support our mentors research requirements (Mr. Maxim Bargilovsky and Prof. Arnon Sturm). 
##### This system will allow manage labeling projects, whose products will constitute the data that will train the ML model 
##### (that extracts relationships and entities from a set of requirements presented in the form of user stories).

## What you get from Tagram

![Tagram demo](https://ibb.co/SrHXGjz)

- **User managment** sign up and login, when you make actions it's tied to your account.
- **Create new annotation project** project manager can create new project, uploat data file, set its name and description, set metatagging and add annotaitors.
- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.
- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.
- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. 
- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. 
- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.
- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline

## Try out Tagram


### Install locally with pip

```bash
## todo
```

#### Apply frontend changes

The frontend part of Label Studio app lies in the `frontend/` folder and written in React JSX. In case you've made some changes there, the following commands should be run before building / starting the instance:

```
cd label_studio/frontend/
npm ci
npx webpack
cd ../..
python label_studio/manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```


## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio 

Label Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:

## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio

Connect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).
2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.

This lets you:

- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. 
- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. 
- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.

## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools

You can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  

* Use the [Label Studio Frontend](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-frontend) as a separate React library. See more in the [Frontend Library documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/frontend.html). 

## Ecosystem
